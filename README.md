# SquadUp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/veyorokon/SquadUp)

SquadUp is a platform that allows users to create, share and discover (CSD) subscription services.

  - Subscriptions can be any reocurring payment (rent, phone, Netflix etc.).
  - Squads encapsulate subscriptions so they can be CSD'ed on SquadUp.
  - SquadUp rewards content creators with 100% of profit generated by squads.

# New Features!

  - Squad card images are now optionally available.


You can also:
  - Create squads for free.
  - Invite members to your squad.

### Tech

SquadUp uses a number of open source and free tier projects to work properly:

* [ReactJS] - Front end JS framework
* [Django] - Backend framework built with python
* [npm] - Package manager for installing ReactJS modules
* [Mixpanel] - User data analytics and tracking
* [Docker] - Platform independent portable development
* [Graphene] - GraphQL framework for python
* [Apollo] - Caching GraphQL client for GraphQL servers
* [Material-UI] - React components that implement Google's Material Design.
* [Stripe] - Python library for the Stripe API.

### Installation

SquadUp requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8.11.4+ to run.

Install the backend dependencies and build the container.

```sh
$ cd ..
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

If this is the first time after a fresh install, create a Django super user and follow the prompt.

```sh
$ docker-compose exec backend bash
$ ./manage.py createsuperuser
```

While still inside the backend container, make migrations. Exit this container after this step.

```sh
$ ./manage.py makemigrations
$ ./manage.py migrate
$ exit
```

Django Admin is available.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000/api/admin/
```

GraphIQL is available on the backend in development environments.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000/api/graphql/
```

Configure Mixpanel and Stripe keys for 'local' or 'prod' by running e.g.:
```sh
$ ./config prod
```

Install the frontend dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd frontend
$ npm install -d
$ npm start
```

Verify the deployment of frontend by navigating to localhost port 3000 in your preferred browser. *Mixpanel integrations will not work in Chrome but works in Safari.*

```sh
127.0.0.1:3000
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ Install instructions needed.
```

### Common Errors
> could not translate host name "postgres" to address: Name or service not known

Make sure you have added '127.0.0.1 postgres' to your /etc/hosts file.
